/**
 * Exact geometry of planar rigid motions of cube pieces, the single source of
 * truth for rotation moves (see design/2026-10-19-rotation-moves.md).
 *
 * A motion that rotates about an axis-aligned line and translates
 * perpendicular to it keeps every cube in its axial layer, and cubes of
 * different layers can only touch on a face plane. So the 3D question reduces
 * exactly to 2D: per axial layer, moving squares against static squares.
 *
 * Physical model: every cube is an axis-aligned cube of side 1 - play,
 * centred in its grid cell, whose edges parallel to the rotation axis are
 * rounded with radius rounding. play = 0.081, rounding = 0 is the model the
 * Fortran SimpleRot code and rotationRules_c use implicitly.
