/** \page xmpuzzleFormat The xmpuzzle format
 *
 * I will try to explain some of the features of the xmpuzzle file format. But please keep
 * in mind that this will only be a starting point and if you need more details please look
 * at the code.
 *
 * The xmpuzzle format is an xml file containing all information regarding a puzzle. It is recursively
 * structured just like the different components are structured in the library. I will try to explain the
 * components bottom up instead of top down.
 *
 * Let's start with one of the base structures of the library: the voxel space. Voxel spaces are
 * stored in voxel nodes. Those nodes need to contain x, y and z attributed with the size in the corresponding
 * direction, also always available must be the type attribute, which currently has no meaning and is always 0.
 * It is intended for future different ways to save a voxel space, and will probably never be used.
 *
 * Optional attributes are the weight and the name.
 *
 * The content of the voxel space node is the description of what the voxel space looks like. There must be
 * content for each voxel in the space, so no shortcuts are possible. There are mainly 3 characters: "_" for
 * empty voxels, "+" for variable voxels and "#" for fixed voxels. The filled voxels may additionally
 * have a colour appended. This colour information is simply put behind the voxel information, so #1 stands for a
 * voxel with colour 1. The colour is saved in decimal form.
 *
 * The gridtype is a basic class in the library and saved simply by adding a gridtype node with an attribute type.
 * The type is a number corresponding with the grid.
 *
 * Assemblies are saved by simply listing the positions of all involved pieces. These positions are made up of
 * the orientation and the place, where the hotspot of that piece is inside the solution. If a piece is not used
 * within an assembly a single x is used to show that fact.
 *
 * Orientations in this class are gridtype dependent and simply numbers, where 0 means original orientation and all
 * other numbers some transformation. The transformation matrixes for the orientations are defined in the tabs_x
 * subdirectories.
 *
 * The assembly itself is now a node with a text content and that text content contains the list of number.
 *
 * The disassembly is saved as a recursive structure of nodes. Each instance contains a list of states that describe how
 * to separate the current puzzle into 2 parts. Then the same structure follows to explain how those 2 parts can be
 * disassembled.
 *
 * The first thing is a list of pieces involved in the current disassembly instruction. That list is normally
 * the complete list of pieces for the root separation instruction but contains subsets of those for the
 * sub structures.
 *
 * The list first contains a number of pieces followed by the pieces as a text with numbers
 *
 * Now come the states. Each state contains the positions that all the pieces have at a certain
 * step. The states do contain 3 subnodes with the x, y and z coordinates of all pieces
 *
 * At last 2 nodes follow with the sub-separation instructions
 *
 * Ok, I think that that explains the main complicated structures of the file. The rest is simple xml stuff
 * with absolutely no magic. If you don't understand some of it have a look at the source. Normally is is quite
 * simple to find out where the information is loaded as all sub information is placed on the same level. So
 * for example bitmap node is within the problem node, so have a look in the problem loader, find the bitmap case
 * and then you find the subclass or code that loads that part.
