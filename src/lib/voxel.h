   * be possible to rotate a voxel space and place it at the same position without

   * the exact corner where is is, but it requires rotation independent centre definition
   *
   * a different interpretation of the hotspot:
   *
   * Observe, that a shape must always be in the first octant (x, y and z positive) regarding
   * the coordinate system because of the way the coordinates are handled. This means that rotations
   * can never be exact mathematical rotations around the source of the coordinate system
   * there is always a translation added that brings the shape back into the first octant.
   *
   * This added translation adds a major headache because it is dependent on the shape itself
   * its size and shape. It is easy to calculate for cubes, but impossible to easily find out
   * for the more obscure grids like the triangles.
   *
   * To make the rotation appear to be around the centre the hotspot contains the added translation
   * that shifted the whole shape into the first quadrant.
   *
   * Now it becomes simple to rotate voxel spaces in space without knowing their exact position.
   * All you do it rotate the position round the source
