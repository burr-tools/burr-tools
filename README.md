This repository contains the BurrTools code with some modernisations
to make it run on modern systems. You can download BurrTools from the 
[Releases page](https://github.com/burr-tools/burr-tools/releases/).

BurrTools was written by Andreas Röver, small patches provided by
several authors. Original README below.

BurrTools is a library to solve burr-type puzzles. Bundled with the
library comes a graphical program that lets you edit the puzzles and
view the found solutions.

The real documentation is inside the executable-file as on-line help.
And also available as a pdf for off-line reading or printouts.

I've also been able to bundle a few puzzles with the program to
demonstrate its features. Thanks to the designers. You can find these
puzzles in the examples subdirectory.

The library that contains all the mathematical and algorithmical stuff
is documented using doxygen. You can generate that documentation using
the doxygen.cfg file that is in the source-code of the program. I tried
to include algorithmic as well as organisatorical comments into the
doxygen documentation.

Have fun.
